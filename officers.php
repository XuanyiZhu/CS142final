                        Caitlin Bliss is currently a senior electrical engineering major. She became interested in engineering because math and science, two of her favorite subjects, were such a large part of engineering. The past two years she has interned at Green Mountain Power in Vermont and fell in love with the utilities side of engineering. Outside of school she loves to ski, hangout with friends and eat. She considers herself addicted to food.
